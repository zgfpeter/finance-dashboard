framer motion lets you animate html elements easily.
instead of writing @keyframes in css, you can tell a component:
"Here's how i want you to look in different states, and when the user interacts ,switch between these states"

variants: named animation states
A variant is like a "label" for a set of styles that you want to animate to.

Example:

const boxVariants = {
  initial: { x: 0, opacity: 0.5 },  // starting state
  hover: { x: 100, opacity: 1 }     // when hovered
};

initial - what it looks like before anything happens
hover - what it should become on hover

using the variants
<motion.div
  variants={boxVariants}  // attach our variant object
  initial="initial"       // start in the 'initial' state
  whileHover="hover"      // when hovered, switch to the 'hover' state
  style={{
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    backgroundColor: 'red'
  }}
/>

Think of a variant as a named "pose" for an object.
intial - how i look when i first appear
hover - how i look when the mouse is over me 
tap - how i look like when the user clicks me
animate - the default animation i play automatically

So instead of manually writing:
div:hover { transform: rotate(0deg); }
you just define 
hover: { rotate: 0 }


a variant is a dictionary of named animation states for the element 
each key is a state label, like initial, hover, tap, or any name i choose
each value is an object of styles or transform properties you want to animate
ex 
variants = {
  initial: { rotate: 5, opacity: 0.5 },
  hover: { rotate: 0, opacity: 1 },
  tap: { scale: 0.9 }
}


special state names
initial - starting pose before any animation
hover - when the mouse is on the element
tap - when tapped or clicked
you can also define custom names if you want, like open, closed, active

how to apply them

initial = "initial" -> tells framer motion ot start the element in the pose named initial 
whileHover = "hover" -> tells framer motion to switch to the pose named hover when hovered 
whileTap = "tap" -> tells framer motion to switch to the tap pose when clicked or tapped
